# CZ2001 Project 2

This is a python notebook intended to find out the top-1, top-2 and top-k nearest hospital node 
from every node in an undirected, unweighted graph network. 

## Description

This project includes 2 algorithms, namely:
1. Multisource Breadth First Search (MBFS)

This algorithm aims to fulfill (a) and (b) and it is used to find out the top-1 nearest hospital node.

2. Mastermind algorithm

This proposed algorithm is a unique extension to the MBFS originally designed by our group
and it aims to fulfill (c) and (d) and it is used to find out the top-2 and top-k nearest hospital nodes.
